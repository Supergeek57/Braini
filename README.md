# Braini

Braini is a fun memory game designed to help people associate names with pictures, from coworkers’ faces to anatomy diagrams.

I designed Braini to be a quick, easy, and fun memory game experience that would help busy students and professionals to mentally associate names and images. 
For example, for someone who recently attended a networking event, associating names with faces of people they met might be critical for maintaining relationships and getting connected with opportunities in the future. 
For a new hire, learning colleagues’ names quickly can be critical for integrating into a new team. 
I also envision students using Braini to quickly review diagrams from their class notes to stay refreshed on topics even when they don’t have time for a full study session.
